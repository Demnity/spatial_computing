> Here you should include the process and product of your 4th activity: **Forming**

| Title     | Forming (process): Form (product)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective | Document the process and products and provide explanations to ensure reusability of materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Procedure | Finalize the plans and the forms of all functional units. Optionally, choose a way to alter the jaggedness of voxels in the final form by partially bringing in contrasting curvy shapes, for instance as a shell around the building, e.g. through smoothing, relaxation, iso-surfaces, or topological transformation. | -->

# Forming Product

## Forming the first model

The first model is created by using the first tileset and the final mesh (all agents combined). The result looks like this:

## Forming the second model

The second model is created by using the second and the third tileset. Agents that are living spaces have the second tileset. Other agents have the third tileset. The result looks like this:
