# Spartial Computing: Gaudi Invers

This website was created for the Spatial Computing in Architectural Design Minor at the TU Delft, as given at the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.

The name Gaudi Invers derives from two parts first of Gaudi was a meticulous designer that was known for designing individual components to excess. This is exactly the opposite goal of the minor. Meaning that the goal was to let the computer generate as much as possible. The architectural part derrives from this name as well.

The group consists of three bachelor and one briding program student.
