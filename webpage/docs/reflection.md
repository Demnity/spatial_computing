# Group reflection

The group reflection is specific towards us as a group and the growth process that was made between 08/11/2021 and 25/01/2022.

We wish to thank Pirouz and Shervin for the creation and constant improvement of the minor. We do think we came out as more educated and better decision making students.

## Result:  

After the final presentation certain improvements were made aware which occured during the following days. We reran the agent growth and came to a more agreeable calculation time. we created a second facade tile set specifcally for living spaces. this leads to a more varied facade of which we can be more proud. 

## Group process:

Overal the group process went smooth, we all have different qualities that came to light during the project. The initial personal assessment regarding the self assigned role was in general correct. Though it can be said that people often grew towards what was needed in the group at that moment. Everybody had their own expertise and that shows during the presentation. We do agree with the need for maximum diverse group formation as that leads to more intresting projects.

## Group communication:

Throughout the process we used a lot (to many) forms of communication which sometimes led to confusion. If we were to redo the minor. we would start with Discord as that would have been better. Discord combines the messaging of Whatsapp and Slack with the online video confrencing of Zoom and Skype.
