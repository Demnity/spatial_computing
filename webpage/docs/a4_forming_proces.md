| Objective | Document the process and products and provide explanations to ensure reusability of materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Procedure | Finalize the plans and the forms of all functional units. Optionally, choose a way to alter the jaggedness of voxels in the final form by partially bringing in contrasting curvy shapes, for instance as a shell around the building, e.g. through smoothing, relaxation, iso-surfaces, or topological transformation. |

# Architecture

The goal of the architectural part of the project is to make the building look habitable and appealing while at the same time being modular and efficient. The key problem here is that the façade will easily look repetitive, therefore making it look less appealing.

The first challenge to overcome was to create façade tiles that are laid over the final mesh. These tiles have to fit to the mesh, making sure that there are no gaps or weird corners. In the picture below, you can see the first tile set. The set was inspired by the Casa Milà, a building by Antoni Gauì. The reason why this inspiration is chosen, is Gaudì’s process of design is completely different to our process. Gaudì spent a lot of time on details, creating incredibly complex buildings where every corner is different. On the contrary, our façade is a series of equal elements. The main challenge here is to capture a similar, lively and expressive feel by using a completely different method.
